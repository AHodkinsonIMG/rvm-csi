# Meeting info

For your meetings, you've been given a unique, recurring, open (no host required), Zoom meeting. You may use it as-needed without worry about Zoom conflicts with other groups. The meeting details are:

- Meeting link: https://zoom.us/j/92635498420
- Passcode: 175046
- Join link: https://zoom.us/j/92635498420?pwd=emVnY2h3VlFuQUhyREZrcG5KVEFBUT09
- The code to assume host ownership is: 072613

When you schedule your meetings, please create them on your own calendar and add the tech.meetings@riscv.org email address. This will allow your meeting to show on the RISC-V Technical Meetings calendar. If you have questions on how to do this, see the Tech Chairs: Adding a Meeting section on the Technical Overview wiki page.

When you run meetings, we ask that you claim the host role upon joining the meeting. Using the code above, follow the directions on the Tech Chairs: Using Zoom wiki page for how to claim the host ownership.

To learn more about running meetings, we recommend you read:
  Getting Started / Overview 
The RISCV Policy: Chairs Best Practices is also helpful, especially one for the first set of bullets at the top for new chairs in new groups:
  RISCV Policy: Chairs Best Practices 
We leave the timing and frequency of your meetings to you as chair/vice-chairs, but ask that you start all meetings with our Disclaimers. Please read these, ask questions needed, and use them as-is or embed them in your meeting information:

You may also elect to play the video that Mark recorded of the disclaimers:

That's probably more than you needed in a single email, but enough to answer the first round of questions. Please don't hesitate to reach out to any of us when you have questions.
